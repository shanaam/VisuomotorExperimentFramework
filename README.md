# VisuomotorExperimentFramework wiki!

## This is an experiment creation tool for experimenters.

## Please see our wiki for more details!

## This tool is flexible: 
You can create common visuomotor learning experiments with little to no coding using our frameworks.
You can also create custom experiments that build on top of one of our base tasks, starting at various levels of abstraction within a task.

Currently supported tasks include: 
- Reaching tasks (e.g. visuomotor rotation tasks)
- Head-based gaze tracking tasks (e.g. localization tasks)
- Billiard type tasks (e.g. the pingolf experiment)
- Driving / trail making tasks 

For paradigms like visuomotor rotations, we also have hardware and accessories you can use in the lab
